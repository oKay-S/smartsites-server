							<h2>About This Research</h2>
							<h3>Extrapolated from the literature review found at the bottom of the page</h3>
							<p>Mass Gatherings (MGs) are a natural evolution of human society as we move further into
								metropolitan areas. Yet even without the COVID-19 pandemic MGâ€™s are a massive health risk, with it
								being incredibly difficult to get emergency crews into an incident zone in an MG. Mass gatherings
								also have an increased risk for such incidents to happen in the first place.</p>

							<p>It is more important than ever to provide technology solutions to monitoring crowd
								levels. This technology solution is to utilise basic capacity management techniques incorporating IoT
								Wi-Fi Probing to estimate the number of persons in one particular area. Although this research will
								not widely adopt Wi-Fi positioning, the utilisation of multiple routers can increase accuracy
								drastically and therefore it is imperative we learn from this section of the research to try to utilise
								more than one access point where possible. The board this research will continue on be the Raspberry
								Pi 4 due to its high versatility and built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. This research will be published on the
								GPL License due to its safeguards and ability to let genuine users adopt the software without fear of
								malicious use or mass commercialisation. This is incredibly important to the overall project as this
								research could lead to crowd tracing, which is not at all what this research is about. This research is to
								help give data to authorities and businesses on how large crowds are without the need for expensive
								equipment or vast estimations.</p>

							<h2>Further Research</h2>

							<p>More work must be done on how we can use figures raised by the finished project to
								estimate real crowd size instead of the crowd size of those that have such devices. This could be
								potentially done with a machine learning algorithm that is trained on both real crowd size and
								estimated crowd size. This would create a much more accurate picture of the crowd and would
								therefore be much more useful to those involved. </p>
